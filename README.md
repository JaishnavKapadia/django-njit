NJIT WEB DEV PROJECT

Business Idea:
The Campus Navigator application is designed to revolutionize the campus experience for students, faculty, and visitors at NJIT. It addresses the challenge of navigating our extensive campus by providing a user-friendly and feature-rich solution.

The Problem:
Navigating a large and complex campus can be overwhelming, especially for newcomers.
Students and visitors often struggle to find specific buildings, offices, and services, leading to frustration, delays, and inefficiencies in campus operations. Additionally, emergencies and safety concerns require quick and accurate information dissemination.

The Solution:
The Campus Navigator application is the solution to these challenges. It offers an interactive and intuitive map interface that simplifies campus navigation. Users can easily locate buildings, access indoor navigation with floor-to-floor mapping, discover essential services, and receive real-time updates.

By providing a comprehensive and user-centric navigation tool, the Campus Navigator
application aims to enhance the overall campus experience, improve efficiency, and contribute to the safety and well-being of our campus community. It empowers users to navigate with confidence, find resources effortlessly, and stay informed about campus events and emergencies.
